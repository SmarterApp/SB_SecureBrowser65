# Here is a sample AUP exempt list file
# This is a comment
# STRICT - only an exact URL match is exempt, though it is tolerant of trailing slashes
# brooklynmuseum.org = www.brooklynmuseum.org
# ALL - all pages from a specified path will not need AUP acceptance
#     - The * wildcard will do a domain match, but only with the ALL filter

# Some sample entries:
allowed[*.slashdot.org, ALL];
allowed[www.mozdevgroup.com, ALL];
allowed[www.brooklynmuseum.org/departments/libraries/, STRICT];
allowed[*.mozilla.org, ALL];
