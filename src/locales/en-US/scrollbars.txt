There are two scrollbar states in the Kiosk, normal and wide.
Normal state is the default. To make the scrollbars wide, you have to activate 
a new theme in the Firefox browser.

1) Close down the Kiosk.
2) Open Firefox browser.
3) Install the BMA Kiosk Firefox Theme (wide scrollbars) 
4) Restart Browser
5) Go to Tools->Add-ons->Themes and select BMA Theme
4) Shutdown all windows and restart for it to take effect.

The theme is essentially a clone of the Firefox Classic theme.
